  - :content: When I first encountered this show, I put it off for the longest time
      because I thought it would just be a cheap rip-off of Family Guy, but it's actually
      turned out to be amazing. Unlike Family Guy, the show overall has stayed funny
      throughout all seven seasons. It also doesn't exploit one random ...read moreflashback
      after another (it uses them only when necessary to the plot), and the characters
      are unique and far more relatable than FG's cast. Highly recommended, and I
      can't wait for NF to post season 8.

      in Season 8, when the kid speaks in Japanese, it never has English subtitles?
      Because on TV and in the other seasons, the subtitles are there. He's really
      funny and this makes me sad.

      like that show. American Dad is bursting with humor, and no matter how...read
      more much you think you know the characters, they will always end up doing something
      that will shock, or entertain you! On the other hand, this show can be amazingly
      inappropriate, so if you are planning to watch this with your kids, or family
      in general, I would skim over the episodes before you choose the one you want
      them to see. Over all, this show is fabulous, the only downside is that they
      will not be continuing the show after season nine, which is almost over. Netflix
      only contains eight seasons of this show, but the ninth season can be purchased
      on Apple, or you can watch them on Demand, although Apple might end up having
      more episodes. If you really like this series, I would also recommend The Cleveland
      Show, or Bob's Burgers. Thank You!

      my faith but I definitely appreciate the amount of creativity they produce as
      far as always keeping you on the edge of your seat wondering what spin they

      point as you would think. I feel the actors are clever, exciting and amazingly
      entertaining. It keeps you guessing and usually your guess is wrong and the
      outcome of the situation is very different from what you had anticipated. I
      love every minute of the weekly series and wish it was on longer. An hour is
      just not long enough to take it all in. I absolutely love Scandal and can't
      wait for the next season to begin to find out who Quinn Perkins really is and
      what she's up to. And so, as with any good mystery, the plot thickens.

      they're working for the CIA, the crazy manipulative antics of Daniel Lugo, the

      for sure, but true nonetheless. You can always expect a lot of flash and dash
      and a sharp crisp picture in a Michael Bay flick. Mark Wahlberg is excellent
      as Daniel Lugo, self made man and fitness guru-wannabe. He has a Pla...read
      moren and he is a "Doer". A lot of fast talking and misdirection and he gets
      his way in to things that most people couldn't even dream about. He is also
      a master manipulator. Dwayne Johnson is outstanding as usual. This is his best
      performance on screen yet. Wonderful portrayal of a tough character to cover.
      Paul Doyle was a confused man who wanted to do good and eventually let Daniel
      Lugo talk him into doing things that made his brain spin. His love of God and
      his yearning for the structured life of prison were in direct conflict with
      the crazy, fast paced, by the seat of your pants lifestyle that Lugo was leading
      him into. Then, the drugs. His way of coping and his way of trying to stay strong
      and keep himself from breaking down or killing himself. Overall, the acting
      in this movie was outstanding. Obviously murder and stealing a mans life through
      beatings and torture are not funny. That is why this movie wins, because Bay
      was able to sell it with comedy but still remind you that it happened for real
      and that there are real consequences and peoples lives at stake. Ed Harris is
      great as usual. Steady as he goes. Tony Shalhoub is excellent. His character
      was a douche bag that made it hard to feel sorry for him. He didn't deserve
      what happened to him, at least not all of it, but nonetheless, it did. Great
      movie. A great watch.

      always felt it was OK, but the next one should be really good now that they've
      gotten all that introductory business out of the way. And in my opinion they
      did just that. I enjoyed it from start to finish. It took several viewings of
      the first film to get used to the new Enterprise crew. I grew up on Shatner,
      Nimoy, Kelley and the rest of the gang. The films at least, the series was before
      my time and I never really watched it until recently. Star Trek II, IV and VI
      (the last of which I saw in the theater when I was 11 or so) are among my favorite
      movies of all time. Wrath Of Khan probably being in my top 3 favorite movies
      ever. I did not go into this movie knowing any spoilers or plot elements that
      were going to be used, so the fact they were going to be leaning heavily on
      material from WoK was a surprise, and one I enjoyed. I didn't like it better
      than WoK, but I thought it made a cool sort of alternate version/supplement
      material to be enjoyed alongside it. I also detected some plot elements of VI,
      just a little bit, with the political intrigue involving Starfleet and the Klingons.
      Yes these new Trek films are very different from what I grew up with, but I
      think they're very fun, and I thought this film delivered on what I had been
      hoping for but didn't quite get with the first. It was nice to see them as a

      A few of the past movies were not as exciting as others, but they all seemed
      like long, big versions of the episodic treatments. JJ Abrams brought a new
      eye to the Star Trek universe that I think Mr. Roddenberry would not just enjoy
      but would cherish. When he created Star Trek it was the fastest whiz bang event
      ever imagined. Mr. Abrams not only modernized it or to use current terms, "re
      imagined", he in every way kept it with in the Star Trek code. Yes, the new
      movies are more action packed than the originals, that is part of the updated
      style; the original series could not afford or imagine such effects. So many
      fans of the originals spew their hate for these new movies because they are
      not the same as the older versions. How sad that they did not grow up or grow
      their imagination. To them I say enjoy the past and your limited capacity, while
      I grab another bag of popcorn and explore new worlds, new civilizations and
      go boldly where the small brains will never be able to go. And to speak of the
      lack of thick, dense story lines...when did Star Trek ever come across as some
      kind of great literature? From the very start the plots and tales were simple
      and usually unrealistic to our actual world; that is what was fun, the action,
      the effects and the exploration of a perceived future. Very fun movie. And the
      "re imagining" of lines and scenes from past movies was a thrill to this life

      here are critical questions that occurred within a span of 2ish minutes during
      the final act: Why is Kahn, a far superior fighter, running away from Spock?
      How does Spock, in order to continue the chase, manage a vertical leap that
      would put Muggsy Bogues to absolute shame? Why does Kahn keep throwing Spock
      back onto the high-elevated platform they''re fighting upon instead of throwing
      him straight off, to quick and certain death? Why is a translator, rather than
      a warrior, sent down to assist Spock in subduing the super-warrior Kahn? (Never
      mind that all these ridiculous moments are necessary just to get to an even
      more ridiculous deus ex machina resolution.) A partial answer to all these questions
      (and many others far too numerous, though often much more significant, to mention)
      is that the filmmakers had other goals, were willing to sacrifice plausibility
      to fit them in, and thought we wouldn''t notice. Not cool. But hey, Benedict

      the original series, while doing such a phenomenally poor job of it. The biggest
      problem I had with watching this movie, is one that many movies have. Its simply
      not believable. This breaks the immersion, and makes it harder to simply sit
      back and enjoy the show. Everything from the unrealistic storyline, to the physics
      goes into this. So, without giving spoilers, the position jumping that takes
      place was one of the first problems. You wonder what kind of organization would
      allow stuff like this, particularly a military organization. Although when you
      take into account the kind of organization, scotty's role in this suddenly becomes
      much more palatable. The physics were so bad, that I couldn't help but be distracted.
      My final problem with the story, was the cheap rip off of Khan. I like Cumberbatch,
      so its hard to say that. But comparing the 2 stories, this is infinitely weaker.
      Still, despite all its problems, it was enjoyable to watch. However I doubt

      Cumberbatch is entirely wasted as the one-note retread of Khan, who, again,
      is basically the exact same villain as Eric Bana in the first film. The action
      was heavy, onerous, and uninteresting, the 'iconic Trek' moments (tribbles,
      KHAN, the reactor thing, etc.) intended to appeal to an audience familiar with
      the universe only at a surface level were ghastly, uncomfortable, and entirely

      the story, or the gore. I just LOVED the way Quentin Tarantino directed. The
      soundtrack, the camera angles, there's a lot of subliminal stimulation, that
      will make you LOVE this movie. You may not even be able to explain why. I'm
      going on 19 years old now, and I still make it a point to watch Volume 1 and
      2 every so often. I highly recommend watching this, and more of Quentin Tarantino's
      work, if you're not familiar with him. He is a true artist.

      "Kill Bill Vol. 2" can't even be called a crappy sequel, because it is so unlike
      its predecessor. "Vol. 1" is a straight-up action movie, filled with questions,
      fight scenes, and fun. But "Vol. 2" is the film that provides the answers, and
      the film only brings a credit of one intense battle, so this film doesn't bring
      the entertainment and fun value the other did. But that doesn't mean this isn't
      a perfect film. At this point we are so involved with Kiddo's life that we know
      everything she's done in the past, and every single character has a place in
      our mind, something most sequels can barely accomplish. Quentin Tarantino purposefully
      did this to make a more dramatic closing, but overall this is just a big achievement
      in filmmaking, even more so than "Vol. 1". The great script, cinematography,
      and the score all create such a nice atmosphere, but the acting is the thing
      that propels the film to new heights. Thurman is even better this time around,
      but the supporting characters like Elle Driver, Budd, and Bill are all so well
      played (and written by Tarantino) that the film becomes such a fascinating character
      study that it's hard not to watch every move these characters make. "Kill Bill
      Vol. 2" overall is a very successful sequel that improves over the 1st in my
      opinion. Tarantino is a filmmaking master, and it's hard to say this is one
      of his best-- every movie he's ever made is one of his best. Highly recommended.

      straight to the point, without any additional crap, and tells the story how
      it is. And that's the way I like it too. And this story is a simple revenge
      ...read moremovie.You can see Tarantino's signature in every second of the movie.
      He is in total control and knows what he wants, even in the fight scenes.Unlike
      vol 1, it has more dialogue, more dramatic scenes. You get to know the characters.
      And the characters in this movie express more in looks and posture more than
      the average movie in words. The movie is less raw and violent than vol 1. But
      the few fight scenes are meticulously choreographed.There are numerous homages
      in this movie, to the Westerns, the kung fu genre, cameo appearances etc.Uma
      Thurman wouldn't be my first pick for the role. She doesn't project the mean
      killer role. she looks too fragile, in fact. Everybody else in the cast is simply
      superb. Michael Madsen and Michael Parks in brilliant performances.The music
      in Tarantino movies is always over-dramatic but also an integral part of the
      movie. Sometimes he misses but usually the songs and score fall right in place.Any
      young director that learns how to make movies should watch Quentin Tarantino
      movies, because he is one of the best ever.

      cast is equally excellent; their characters are rich and multi-dimensional.
      The costumes, arms and armor look plausible, down to their tiny details. The
      battles are brutal and breathtaking. The city of Rome itself feels alive - dirty,
      chaotic, gaudy, beautiful, massive, sweltering. And yes, the plot is exciting
      and holds the viewer''s interest. My one complaint (and I realize I''m nit-picking
      here) is that the writers butchered Roman history in order to have a stunning
      climax on the floor of the Colosseum: the actual emperor Commodus outlived his
      sister Lucilla by ten years (he killed her, not the other way around), and his
      murder brought the brutal Severan dynasty to power - a return of the Republic
      was never in the cards! It seemed a shame to me that with everything in this
      film feeling so authentic (down to the smallest details), that something so
      "big" would be so blatantly incorrect. That said, it''s still a great film -

      Joaquins Larger than Life Commodus (which is Genre Relevant), apparently He
      lost to a more Subdued and Subtle Performance because "that is acting" but its

      which sets this film apart.To know they were still writing the script while
      shooting and the script changed on a DAILY basis, is part of the magic, plus
      the complication with losing Ollie Reed near the end of filming which cost an
      extra 3.5 million (A lot back then), and A complete Reworking of the ending
      (He was meant to be in the Collosieum with the Figures). WHen you learn about
